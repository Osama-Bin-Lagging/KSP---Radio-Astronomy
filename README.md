# KSP - Radio Astronomy
 Demystifying Radio Astronomy: Fundamentals and Data.     
 
 Radio astronomy, with its unique ability to pierce through dust clouds due to the long wavelengths of radio waves, unveils a hidden universe invisible to optical telescopes.  These waves can travel enormous cosmological distances, offering insights into the universe's earliest epochs like the cosmic dawn and reionization era.  This project will explore the wonders of radio telescopes, some of the most remarkable feats of engineering. We will delve into the analysis of data from these world-class instruments, focusing on pulsars and neutron star mergers. Lastly, we will learn about the Pulsar Timing Array, used in the detection of gravitational wave background.

Learning Outcomes:
Radiative Processes in Astronomy
Aperture synthesis and radio interferometry 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to analyze data
Imaging techniques using CASA
